# Nexus-Events

This repository is a mirror of https://git.shayandoust.me/Nexus/Nexus-Events which is still our active internal repository for the project. Most recent changes will be documented there, and PR should also be done there and not here.

Nexus Events is a multi-gamemode server written by Shayan and Icehax. We incorporate loads of gamemodes such as King of the Hill, Demolition and much more.
